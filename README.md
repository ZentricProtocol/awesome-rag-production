## Reference Architectures

Stop guessing. Here are three battle-tested stacks for different stages of
maturity.

### 1. The Local / Dev Stack (Zero to One)

**Goal:** Rapid prototyping, zero cost, no API keys.

**Stack:**

- **LLM:** **Ollama** (LLaMA 3 / Mistral)
- **Vector DB:** **Chroma** (Embedded)
- **Eval:** **Ragas** (Basic checks)

**Why:** Runs entirely on your laptop. Perfect for "Hello World" and checking
feasibility.

**Risks:** High latency; performance depends on your hardware; no horizontal
scaling.

**Observability Checklist:** `print()` statements and basic logging.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this stack
combination — performance is entirely hardware-dependent. Component-level
data: see [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases) (Chroma) and
[benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured).*

### 2. The Mid-Scale / Production Stack (Speed to Market)

**Goal:** High precision, developer velocity, minimal infra management.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Qdrant** or **Weaviate** (Cloud/Managed)
- **Reranker:** **Cohere Rerank** (API)
- **Tracing:** **Langfuse** or **Arize Phoenix**

**Why:** Offloads complexity to managed services. "It just works" with great documentation.

**Risks:** Costs scale linearly with usage; dependency on external APIs (Vendor
lock-in).

**Observability Checklist:** Latency tracking, Token usage costs, Trace
visualization.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this exact
stack combination. Component-level data available: Qdrant self-published
benchmarks [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases), Anthropic / OpenAI caching
figures [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic). For reranking latency,
see [benchmarks.md § Gaps](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured).*

### 3. The Enterprise / High-Scale Stack (The 1%)

**Goal:** Throughput maximization, data sovereignty, full control.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Milvus** (Distributed)
- **Serving:** **vLLM** (Self-hosted)
- **Eval (CI/CD):** **DeepEval**
- **Monitoring:** **OpenLIT** (OpenTelemetry)

**Why:** You own the data and the compute. Scales to billions of vectors.

**Risks:** Significant operational complexity (Kubernetes); requires a dedicated Platform Engineering team.

**Observability Checklist:** Distributed tracing, Embedding drift detection, Custom SLA alerts, GPU utilization metrics.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this exact
stack. Component-level data: Milvus benchmarks [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases),
vLLM 2–4× throughput vs FasterTransformer [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#5-llm-serving),
ANN-Benchmarks [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases). Enterprise stack
cost depends entirely on cluster sizing — no public reference architecture
pricing exists.*

## Real-World Case Studies

Learn from production RAG implementations at scale. These companies have battle-tested their systems with millions of users.

### Success Stories

- [LinkedIn Engineering — Conversational Job Search](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog)
  - In-house vector DB + BERT embeddings + LLM fine-tuning for professional recommendations. Key insight: member-specific personalization at scale through context injection.

- [Shopify Engineering — E-commerce Merchant Support](https://shopify.engineering/)
  - LangChain + Chroma + GPT-3.5-Turbo chatbot for merchant support. Domain-specific fine-tuning significantly reduced hallucination rate (specific figures unverified — see [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured)).

- [Discord — Message Search at Trillion Scale](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-trillions-of-messages)
  - Custom ANN search + Rust microservices + ScyllaDB for indexing and retrieving trillions of messages. Key insight: Rust-based infrastructure enables ANN search at this scale.

**Common Patterns:**

- Hybrid search (dense + sparse) is standard at scale.
- Custom embedding models outperform off-the-shelf for domain-specific tasks.
- Reranking is critical for precision (top-100 → top-5).
- Extensive A/B testing on retrieval quality before LLM integration.

## Embedding Models

Choosing the right embedding model is one of the highest-leverage decisions in a RAG pipeline — the wrong choice silently degrades retrieval before the LLM ever sees the context.
The [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) \[3P\] is the canonical benchmark for retrieval quality (nDCG@10 on BEIR datasets);
see [benchmarks.md §2](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) for a snapshot with source citations.

| Model | Strengths | Context Window | Hosting | Best For | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [OpenAI text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) | High retrieval nDCG@10 | 8,191 tokens | API | General English retrieval | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Cohere embed-v4](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/embed-2) | Multilingual, int8 support | 512 tokens | API + self-host | Multilingual + cost-efficient | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Voyage voyage-3](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings) | Top MTEB retrieval scores | 32,000 tokens | API | Long-context retrieval | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [BAAI BGE-M3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) | Multi-lingual, multi-granularity | 8,192 tokens | Self-host | Open-weight multilingual | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Nomic nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) | Long context, Apache 2.0 license | 8,192 tokens | Self-host / API | Open, long-context | — |
| [Alibaba gte-multilingual-base](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base) | 70+ languages, compact | 8,192 tokens | Self-host | Multilingual, cost-sensitive | — |
| [Jina jina-embeddings-v3](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3) | Task-adaptive LoRA adapters | 8,192 tokens | Self-host / API | Task-specific fine-tuning | — |

**Selection guide:**

- Use **MTEB Retrieval** scores (nDCG@10 on BEIR) as the primary benchmark — not overall MTEB average, which includes tasks irrelevant to RAG.
- For **domain-specific corpora** (legal, medical, code), fine-tune a base model with `sentence-transformers` on your own labeled pairs; generic MTEB rankings will not predict your performance.
- **Always use the same model** for indexing and querying — mismatched models are a silent recall killer (see [rag-pitfalls.md](rag-pitfalls.md#embedding-model-selection)).
- For **multilingual** pipelines: BGE-M3, Cohere embed-v4, or jina-embeddings-v3 with task adapters.

**Trade-offs:**

- API-hosted models (OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage) eliminate GPU ops overhead but create vendor dependency and add per-token costs at scale.
- Self-hosted open models (BGE-M3, nomic-embed) require GPU at production throughput but unlock full data sovereignty.
- Larger context windows (nomic-embed 8k, voyage-3 32k) are critical for long-document retrieval but increase embedding latency and cost per document.

## Vector Databases

| Tool | Best For | Key Strength | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) | Local/Dev & Mid-scale | Developer-friendly, open-source embedding database. | — |
| [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) | Billions of vectors | Most popular OSS for massive scale. | [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases) |
| [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) | PostgreSQL Ecosystem | Vector search capability directly within PostgreSQL. | — |
| [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) | 10M-100M+ vectors | Zero-ops, serverless architecture. | — |
| [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) | <50M vectors | Best filtering support and free tier. | [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases) [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases) |
| [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) | Hybrid Search | Native integration of vector and keyword search. | — |

## Chunking & Document Processing

How you split documents into chunks is one of the most underrated decisions in a RAG pipeline.
The wrong chunking strategy silently degrades retrieval quality regardless of how good your embedding model is.
See [rag-pitfalls.md — Fixed Chunk Size Everywhere](rag-pitfalls.md#data-ingestion--chunking) for the failure modes.

**Chunking strategies at a glance:**

| Strategy | When to Use | Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fixed-size (token count) | Baseline; simple corpora | Splits mid-sentence/table; safe starting point |
| Recursive character split | General text, mixed formats | Respects paragraph → sentence → word boundaries |
| Semantic chunking | Heterogeneous corpora, varying density | Higher quality; requires an embedding model at index time |
| Document-type aware | PDFs, code, tables, HTML | Best recall; requires per-type parsers |
| Hierarchical / small-to-big | Multi-hop retrieval | Retrieves small chunks, returns parent context to LLM |

- [chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-ai/chonkie)
  - A fast, lightweight chunking library purpose-built for RAG. Supports token,
    sentence, semantic, recursive, and late-chunking strategies in a single API
    with minimal dependencies. Optimized for throughput — suitable for batch
    indexing pipelines.
- [LlamaIndex SemanticSplitterNodeParser](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/)
  - Splits documents at semantically meaningful boundaries by embedding adjacent
    sentences and measuring cosine distance. Produces more coherent chunks than
    fixed-size splitting for narrative and technical content.
- [LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/)
  - The de facto default for general-purpose chunking. Recursively tries separators
    (`\n\n`, `\n`, or a space) to split at natural boundaries within a target token
    window — robust, fast, no extra dependencies.
- [semchunk](https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk)
  - A pure-Python semantic chunking library that requires no embedding model at
    chunk time; it uses statistical sentence boundaries for fast, low-cost semantic
    splitting suitable for large-scale batch indexing.
- [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) — see [Data Ingestion & Parsing](#data-ingestion--parsing) for the full entry.
  - Provides document-type aware parsing (PDF, DOCX, HTML, images) as the upstream
    step before chunking. Pair it with any splitter above for a robust ingestion pipeline.

**Trade-offs:**

- Fixed-size chunking is fast and dependency-free but degrades retrieval on tables, code, and structured content.
- Semantic chunking improves recall on heterogeneous corpora but adds embedding cost at index time and is slower.
- Chunk size affects both retrieval recall (too large = coarse matching) and LLM context quality (too small = missing context);
  256–512 tokens is a common starting point — tune on your own corpus with Ragas or DeepEval.

## Retrieval & Reranking

**Hybrid Search:**
A retrieval strategy that linearly combines Dense Vector Search (semantic
understanding) with Sparse Keyword Search (BM25 for exact term matching). This
mitigates the "lost in the middle" phenomenon and significantly improves
zero-shot retrieval performance.

- [BGE-Reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3)
  - One of the best open-source rerankers available. It is a cross-encoder model
    trained to output a relevance score for query-document pairs, offering
    commercial-grade performance for self-hosted pipelines.
- [Cohere Rerank](https://cohere.com/rerank)
  - A powerful API-based reranking model. By re-scoring the initial top-K
    documents from a cheaper/faster retriever, it substantially improves retrieval
    precision with minimal code changes. Independent benchmarks show cross-encoder
    rerankers outperform bi-encoders by 4+ nDCG@10 points on BEIR
    (\[3P\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#3-reranking)).
- [FlashRank](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/FlashRank)
  - A lightweight, serverless-friendly reranking library. It runs quantized
    cross-encoder models directly on the CPU (no Torch/GPU required), making it
    ideal for edge deployments or cost-sensitive architectures.
- [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille)
  - A library that makes ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT)
    easy to use. ColBERT offers fine-grained token-level matching, providing
    superior retrieval quality compared to standard single-vector dense
    retrieval.

**GraphRAG:**

An advanced retrieval method that constructs a knowledge graph from documents. It
traverses relationships between entities to answer "global" queries (e.g., "What
are the main themes?") that standard vector search struggles to address.

- [Microsoft GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag)
  - Microsoft Research's production-grade graph-based RAG framework. Builds a
    community-aware knowledge graph from documents, enabling both local
    (entity-centric) and global (theme-level) queries with LLM-generated summaries.
- [nano-graphrag](https://github.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag)
  - A lightweight, hackable implementation of the GraphRAG pipeline (~1k lines).
    Ideal for understanding the algorithm or embedding it into custom systems
    without the full Microsoft GraphRAG dependency footprint.
- [LlamaIndex KnowledgeGraphIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/indexing/kg_index/)
  - First-class knowledge graph indexing within the LlamaIndex ecosystem.
    Extracts entity-relationship triples from documents and stores them in graph
    backends (Nebula, Neo4j, TigerGraph) for traversal-based retrieval.
- [Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder)
  - An end-to-end application that extracts knowledge graphs from unstructured
    documents into Neo4j using LLMs. Provides a UI for exploring the resulting
    graph and integrates with LangChain's Neo4j vector + graph retrieval.

## Query Transformation & Routing

Raw user queries are rarely optimal for retrieval — they may be ambiguous, contain typos, be too vague, or require multi-hop reasoning.
Query transformation is the pre-retrieval step that rewrites or expands the query to maximize recall.
Query routing dispatches queries to different retrievers or indexes based on intent classification.
See [rag-pitfalls.md — No Query Transformation](rag-pitfalls.md#retrieval-strategy) for the failure mode.

**Core transformation techniques:**

| Technique | What it does | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) | Generate a hypothetical answer, embed it instead of the query | Technical / domain-specific corpora |
| Multi-Query | Generate N paraphrases of the query, retrieve for each, merge results | Broad coverage, handling ambiguity |
| Step-Back Prompting | Ask a more abstract version of the query first, then retrieve | Multi-hop reasoning, "why/how" questions |
| Query Decomposition | Break a complex query into sub-queries, retrieve independently | Comparative and multi-document tasks |
| Query Routing | Classify query intent and dispatch to the appropriate retriever | Multi-index or multi-domain deployments |

- [LlamaIndex Query Transformations](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/querying/query_engine/)
  - First-class support for HyDE, multi-query, step-back, and sub-question
    decomposition within the LlamaIndex query engine. Each transformation is a
    composable module that slots into existing pipelines without restructuring.
- [LangChain Multi-Query Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/MultiQueryRetriever/)
  - Generates multiple rephrasings of the input query using an LLM, runs each
    against the vector store, and deduplicates results — improving recall for
    ambiguous or under-specified user queries with minimal code.
- [semantic-router](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router)
  - A high-speed semantic decision layer for routing queries to the appropriate
    retriever, index, or tool. Classifies incoming queries by semantic similarity
    to predefined route examples (no LLM inference required for routing itself).
- [LlamaIndex RouterQueryEngine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/querying/router/)
  - LLM-powered query router that selects the best retriever or tool from a
    defined set based on query content — suitable for multi-index RAG deployments
    where different document types live in separate stores.

**When to Transform Queries:**

- HyDE: when your corpus is highly technical and query/document vocabulary mismatch degrades recall.
- Multi-Query: when user queries are short or ambiguous and you have headroom for 2–3× retrieval calls.
- Decomposition: when queries require comparing or aggregating information from multiple documents.
- Routing: when you have multiple indexes (e.g., SQL + vector + web search) and want deterministic dispatch.

**Trade-offs:**

- Each transformation adds at least one extra LLM call — latency and cost scale with the number of sub-queries.
- Multi-query and decomposition increase the number of retrieved chunks fed to the reranker; budget for reranker latency accordingly.
- HyDE can introduce hallucinations in the hypothetical document if the generating model is weak; validate recall improvement on your own eval set before committing.

## Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG represents the evolution of traditional RAG systems into autonomous,
decision-making entities. Instead of a simple "retrieve-then-generate" pipeline,
agentic systems can plan multi-step workflows, use tools, and dynamically adjust
their retrieval strategy based on intermediate results.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break complex queries into sub-tasks
- **Tool Use**: Integrate external APIs, databases, and services
- **Self-Correction**: Validate retrieved context and retry if needed
- **Planning**: Determine optimal retrieval strategy dynamically

### Frameworks & Tools

- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
  - Microsoft's framework for building multi-agent conversational systems. Agents
    can collaborate, debate, and refine answers through back-and-forth dialogue,
    improving output quality through consensus.
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
  - A lightweight framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents.
    Define specialized "crew members" (Researcher, Writer, Critic) that work
    together on complex RAG tasks.
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — see [Frameworks & Orchestration](#frameworks--orchestration) for the full entry.
  - The canonical choice for cyclic, stateful agentic workflows with human-in-the-loop control and memory persistence.
- [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview)
  - A managed service for building agent-like experiences. It provides built-in
    retrieval capabilities, code interpreter, and function calling with minimal
    infrastructure overhead.
- [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) — see [Frameworks & Orchestration](#frameworks--orchestration) for the full entry.
  - Extends the core RAGFlow engine with agentic capabilities: dynamic document re-ranking, query decomposition, and adaptive retrieval strategies based on query complexity.

**When to Use Agentic RAG:**

- Complex, multi-hop questions requiring planning ("Compare X and Y across these 5 documents").
- Integration with external tools (SQL databases, APIs, calculators).
- Tasks requiring validation (fact-checking, citation verification).

**Trade-offs:**

- Higher latency (multiple LLM calls).
- Increased cost (agent reasoning + retrieval).
- Debugging complexity (non-deterministic behavior).

## Multimodal RAG

Production RAG increasingly operates on documents that combine text, images,
tables, and charts — financial reports, technical manuals, and product catalogs
that defeat pure-text chunking. Multimodal RAG extends classical retrieval by
embedding and querying across modalities in a shared vector space, or by treating
document pages as images (ColPali-style), bypassing the OCR → chunk → embed
pipeline and preserving layout information that text extraction destroys.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Vision-document retrieval**: Index full document pages as images; retrieve
  without OCR pre-processing, preserving tables, charts, and diagrams
- **Aligned text/image embedding spaces**: Represent queries and mixed documents
  in a shared vector space for cross-modal search
- **Cross-modal queries**: A text query retrieves image results and vice versa
- **Layout-aware understanding**: Figures, schematics, and tables are searchable
  by their visual content, not just surrounding text

| Tool | Best For | Modalities | Retrieval Style | Production Maturity | Evidence |

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Byaldi](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/byaldi)
  - A thin, production-friendly wrapper around ColPali that provides a simple
    index/query API for late-interaction vision-document retrieval. The fastest
    path to deploying ColPali without writing research code.
- [ColPali](https://github.com/illuin-tech/colpali)
  - A vision-language model that achieves state-of-the-art results on the ViDoRe
    document retrieval benchmark by treating each page as an image. It eliminates
    the fragile OCR → text-chunk → embed pipeline, preserving layout, tables, and
    diagrams that plain text extraction loses.
- [Jina CLIP v2](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-clip-v2)
  - A multilingual text-image embedding model supporting 89 languages with
    competitive retrieval benchmarks. Available as open weights and a managed API,
    it is suited for global products that need cross-lingual visual search.
- [LlamaIndex Multi-Modal](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/multi_modal/)
  - First-class multimodal support within the LlamaIndex ecosystem: dedicated
    loaders, indexes, and query engines for mixing text and images in a single
    production pipeline without switching frameworks.
- [Marqo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo)
  - An open-source multimodal vector engine with CLIP-family models built in. It
    handles the full ingestion-to-search pipeline in one self-hosted service,
    reducing integration overhead for image-heavy corpora.
- [Nomic Embed Vision](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-vision-v1.5)
  - A vision encoder that shares the same embedding space as
    `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. This alignment enables drop-in cross-modal search
    on existing text indexes — add image retrieval without re-indexing.
- [Voyage Multimodal-3](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/multimodal-embeddings)
  - A managed API for embedding interleaved text-and-image documents (e.g., PDFs
    with inline figures). A single API call embeds a mixed document page as one
    vector, slotting into existing retrieval pipelines with minimal code changes.

**When to Use Multimodal RAG:**

- Documents with complex layouts: financial reports, scientific papers, or
  technical schematics where tables and charts carry critical information.
- Product catalogs and e-commerce: image-to-image or text-to-image queries.
- Screenshot or UI documentation retrieval where text extraction is noisy.
- Medical imaging paired with reports — query by image or clinical description.

**Trade-offs:**

- Storage overhead: multi-vector page-image indexes are substantially larger
  than text-chunk indexes (ColPali: ~257.5 KB/page at D=128 vs. ~6 KB/vector for
  standard text embeddings — \[3P\] [ColPali paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449),
  ICLR 2025); plan for object storage and increased embedding costs.
- GPU requirements: vision encoders and ColPali-style late interaction require
  GPU for production throughput; CPU-only deployments face significant latency.
- Evaluation complexity: no universal benchmark for domain-specific multimodal
  retrieval quality — custom human annotation sets are required.

## Evaluation & Benchmarking

Reliable RAG requires measuring the **RAG Triad**: Context Relevance,
Groundedness, and Answer Relevance.

- [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/)
  - An enterprise-grade platform for evaluating and logging LLM outputs. It
    excels at "Online Evaluation," allowing you to score real-world user
    interactions and feed that data back into your development set.
- [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)
  - The "Pytest for LLMs". It offers a unit-testing framework for RAG,
    integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions in retrieval
    quality or hallucination rates before deployment.
- [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
  - A framework that uses an "LLM-as-a-Judge" to evaluate your pipeline. It
    calculates metrics like Faithfulness (did the answer come from the context?)
    and Answer Relevance without needing human-labeled ground truth.

### LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

Using one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another has become a standard practice in production RAG systems.
This approach scales better than human evaluation and provides consistent, automated quality assessment.

**Core Frameworks:**

- [ARES (Automated RAG Evaluation System)](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES)
  - Stanford's research project that fine-tunes small LLMs as judges specifically
    for RAG evaluation, achieving GPT-4-level accuracy at 1/10th the cost.
- [AutoEvals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals)
  - A tool for quickly and easily evaluating AI model outputs using best
    practices, including LLM-as-a-judge and heuristic methods.
- [G-Eval](https://github.com/nlpyang/geval)
  - A framework that uses GPT-4 with chain-of-thought reasoning to evaluate text
    generation quality. It achieves human-level correlation on summarization and
    dialogue tasks.
- [LangChain Evaluators](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview)
  - Built-in evaluation chains for criteria-based scoring, pairwise comparison,
    and embedding distance. Seamlessly integrates with LangSmith for
    production monitoring.
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus)
  - An open-source LLM specifically trained for evaluation tasks. Unlike using
    GPT-4 as a judge, Prometheus is optimized for scoring consistency and can run
    locally for cost-sensitive deployments.

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | What It Measures | Judge LLM Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Faithfulness** | Does the answer come from the retrieved context? | "Does the answer contain information not in the context? Yes/No" |
| **Answer Relevance** | Does the answer address the question? | "Rate how well this answer addresses the question (1-5)" |
| **Context Precision** | Are the top-ranked chunks actually relevant? | "Is this passage relevant to answering the question? Yes/No" |
| **Context Recall** | Did we retrieve all necessary information? | "Is there missing information needed to answer this question?" |

**Best Practices:**

- Use frontier models (GPT-4o, Claude Opus) for critical evaluations — highest agreement with humans.
- Fine-tune smaller models (Llama 3 8B) as judges for cost/latency optimization.
- Chain-of-Thought prompting improves judge consistency and human alignment (G-Eval, EACL 2024).
- Always validate judge performance against human labels on a sample (100–200 examples).
- Be aware of position bias — LLMs tend to favor earlier options in pairwise comparisons.
- LLM judges can inherit biases from their training data; audit regularly.

## Observability & Tracing

- [Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)
  - A tool specifically designed for troubleshooting retrieval issues. It
    visualizes your embedding clusters and retrieved document rankings, helping
    you understand *why* the model retrieved irrelevant context.
- [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)
  - An open-source engineering platform for LLM observability. It captures full
    execution traces (latency, token usage, cost) and allows for "Prompt
    Management," letting you version-control prompts decoupled from your code.
- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith/observability)
  - Built by the LangChain team, this is the gold standard for debugging complex
    chains. It provides a "Playground" to rerun specific traces with modified
    prompts to iterate on edge cases instantly.
- [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit)
  - An OpenTelemetry-native monitoring solution. If you already use
    Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog, OpenLIT drops into your existing stack to
    provide standardized LLM metrics (GPU usage, token throughput).

## Deployment & Serving

- [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
  - A framework for packaging models into standardized APIs (Bentos). It handles
    the complexity of adaptive batching and multi-model serving, allowing you to
    deploy any model to any cloud (AWS Lambda, EC2, Kubernetes) with one
    command.
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
  - The easiest way to run LLMs locally. While primarily for dev/local use, it
    bridges the gap between local testing and deployment by providing a standard
    API for models like LLaMA 3, Mistral, and Gemma.
- [Ray Serve](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
  - The industry standard for scaling Python ML workloads. It allows you to
    compose complex pipelines (e.g., Retriever + Reranker + LLM) where each
    component scales independently across a cluster of machines.
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
  - A high-performance inference engine known for PagedAttention. It maximizes
    GPU memory utilization, allowing you to serve larger models or handle higher
    concurrency with lower latency than standard Hugging Face Transformers.
    PagedAttention delivers 2–4× throughput improvement at the same latency SLO
    (\[3P\] [Kwon et al., SOSP 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)).

## Caching & Performance

Caching is one of the highest-leverage optimizations in production RAG: it
directly reduces cost, cuts p99 latency, and absorbs traffic spikes without
scaling infrastructure. Four distinct cache layers exist, each targeting a
different bottleneck — deploying them in combination yields compounding returns.

**Cache Layers:**

- **Exact-match** — key-value lookup on the full prompt string; instant but only
  hits on byte-identical queries
- **Semantic** — vector similarity search over recent queries; higher hit-rate
  at the cost of a tuned similarity threshold to control false positives
- **Prompt-prefix / Provider-side** — automatic caching of shared context
  prefixes at the LLM provider level (Anthropic, OpenAI); no code changes,
  up to 90% token cost reduction on long shared prefixes
  (\[V\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic))
- **KV-cache / Prefix caching** — inference-engine-level attention state reuse
  (vLLM, SGLang) for self-hosted models with repeated system prompts

| Tool | Cache Type | Layer | Backend | Best For | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Anthropic Prompt Caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) | Prompt prefix | Provider | Anthropic infra | Long system prompts, large contexts | [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic) |
| [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache) | Exact + Semantic | Application | Redis / Milvus / SQLite | Reducing duplicate LLM calls | — |
| [LangChain Cache](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llm_caching/) | Exact + Semantic | Application | In-memory / Redis / SQLite | LangChain-native pipelines | — |
| [LiteLLM Cache](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/caching) | Exact + Semantic | Gateway | Redis / S3 / Disk | Multi-provider routing with cache | — |
| [OpenAI Prompt Caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching) | Prompt prefix | Provider | OpenAI infra | GPT-4o / o-series, shared prefixes | [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic) |
| [RedisVL Semantic Cache](https://github.com/redis/redis-vl-python) | Semantic | Application | Redis Stack | Existing Redis infra, sub-ms lookup | — |
| [vLLM Automatic Prefix Caching](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/automatic_prefix_caching.html) | KV-cache | Inference engine | GPU memory | Self-hosted RAG, shared system prompts | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#5-llm-serving) |

### Tools

- [Anthropic Prompt Caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)
  - Provider-side prefix cache for Claude models that delivers up to 90% cost
    reduction and 85% latency reduction on cached context
    (\[V\] [Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) · 2024).
    Add a `cache_control` breakpoint in the API request — no infrastructure
    changes required.
- [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache)
  - The canonical open-source semantic cache for LLM applications. It intercepts
    LLM calls, runs similarity search over a cache store, and returns hits without
    calling the model — with pluggable similarity functions, eviction policies,
    and storage backends (Redis, Milvus, SQLite).
- [LangChain Cache](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llm_caching/)
  - Built-in exact-match and semantic LLM caching across a broad backend matrix
    (in-memory, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Cassandra, GPTCache). One-line setup for
    LangChain-native pipelines with no architecture changes.
- [LiteLLM Cache](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/caching)
  - Gateway-level caching across 100+ LLM providers with per-route TTL control,
    Redis/S3/Disk backends, and cache-control headers. Pairs with the LiteLLM
    proxy for a unified cost-management and caching layer.
- [OpenAI Prompt Caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching)
  - Automatic prefix caching for GPT-4o and o-series models; requires zero code
    changes and delivers a 50% input-token discount on cache hits
    (\[V\] [OpenAI announcement](https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/) · 2024-10).
    Effective when system prompts or retrieved context blocks exceed 1,024 tokens.
- [RedisVL Semantic Cache](https://github.com/redis/redis-vl-python)
  - A Redis Stack–backed semantic cache library with sub-millisecond lookup
    latency. Leverages Redis Vector Sets for similarity search and supports
    configurable thresholds, TTL, and integration with existing Redis
    infrastructure.
- [vLLM Automatic Prefix Caching](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/automatic_prefix_caching.html)
  - Server-side KV-cache reuse that detects shared prompt prefixes across requests
    and reuses their computed attention states. Significant throughput and latency
    gains for self-hosted RAG deployments where a long system prompt is repeated
    across all queries.

**When to Cache What:**

- **Exact-match** — for FAQ bots and narrow-domain assistants with high query repetition (support portals, internal knowledge bases).
- **Semantic** — for general Q&A where phrasing varies but intent repeats (e.g., "What is the refund policy?" ≈ "How do I get a refund?").
- **Prompt-prefix** — whenever system prompts or retrieved contexts exceed 1,024 tokens; activate Anthropic or OpenAI prompt caching for instant cost savings (\[V\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic)).
- **KV-cache** — for self-hosted inference where the same system prompt is prepended to every request; configure vLLM's APC for immediate throughput gains.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Staleness**: Cached responses become outdated when the underlying knowledge base changes; design TTL and invalidation strategies alongside cache deployment.
- **Semantic false positives**: Similarity-based hits may return answers to slightly different questions; tune thresholds per domain and monitor hit quality.
- **Observability complexity**: Multi-layer caching obscures which layer served a response; instrument cache hit/miss metrics per layer for meaningful cost and latency attribution.

    critical for enterprise chatbots.
- [Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio)
  - Microsoft’s SDK for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and
    redaction. It ensures sensitive user data (credit cards, emails) is scrubbed
    *before* it hits the embedding model or vector DB.
- [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt)
  - A production-ready project that allows you to run RAG pipelines completely
    offline. It ensures 100% data privacy by keeping all ingestion and inference
    local, perfect for highly regulated industries.

## LLM Gateways & Routing

An LLM gateway sits between your application and one or more LLM providers.
It centralizes authentication, enforces rate limits, aggregates cost metrics, enables provider failover,
and often layers caching on top — without requiring per-provider changes to application code.

| Tool | Hosting | Provider Support | Caching | Cost Tracking | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | Self-host / Cloud | 100+ providers | Redis / S3 / Disk | Built-in | Multi-provider routing, OpenAI-compatible proxy |
| [Portkey](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway) | Self-host / Cloud | 200+ providers | Built-in | Dashboard | Enterprise gateway with observability |
| [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) | Self-host / Cloud | OpenAI + Anthropic | Built-in | Fine-grained token analytics | Cost optimization and prompt versioning |
| [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) | Managed | 100+ models | — | Per-request | Unified model marketplace, no infra |
| [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) | Managed (edge) | Major providers | Built-in | Real-time analytics | Edge-deployed, global routing |

- [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
  - An OpenAI-compatible proxy and SDK wrapper supporting 100+ LLM providers
    (Anthropic, Bedrock, Azure, Gemini, local models via Ollama) with a single
    API surface. Includes gateway-level caching, per-route rate limits, fallback
    routing, and a cost dashboard. The most widely adopted open-source gateway.
- [Portkey AI Gateway](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway)
  - A high-performance open-source gateway with provider failover, load balancing,
    semantic caching, and virtual API keys. Supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints
    for 200+ providers and integrates with LangChain, LlamaIndex, and raw SDKs.
- [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone)
  - A developer-first observability and gateway platform. One-line integration
    (change base URL) adds token-level cost tracking, latency dashboards, prompt
    versioning, and caching — without any SDK changes. Particularly strong on cost
    attribution per user, team, or feature.
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
  - A managed model marketplace routing requests to 100+ open and proprietary
    models. Provides unified billing, automatic fallback, and model comparison
    without running any infrastructure — best for prototyping or multi-model
    evaluation.
- [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/)
  - An edge-deployed LLM gateway integrated into the Cloudflare network. Adds
    caching, rate limiting, and real-time analytics with sub-millisecond routing
    overhead; suitable for globally distributed applications where gateway latency
    is a constraint.

**When to Use an LLM Gateway:**

- Multi-provider deployments requiring failover (primary → fallback on 5xx or rate-limit).
- Centralized cost attribution across teams, features, or customers — critical for unit economics.
- Enforcing per-user or per-route rate limits without embedding this logic in every microservice.
- Caching at the gateway layer to complement application-level caches (see [Caching & Performance](#caching--performance)).

**Trade-offs:**

- Self-hosted gateways (LiteLLM, Portkey) add an extra network hop and a component to operate; invest in HA deployment if you route all traffic through them.
- Managed gateways (OpenRouter, Cloudflare) simplify ops but add another vendor dependency and may introduce latency for non-edge traffic.
- Gateway-level semantic caching has the same false-positive risk as application-level caching — tune thresholds carefully.
